## Confidence Level Assignment for Initial Cheatsheets

**Date:** 2026-02-18
**Project:** agentsouls setup
**Context:** Creating the first 4 cheatsheets required assigning confidence levels to each piece of knowledge.
**Options Considered:**
1. Mark everything [TEXTBOOK] — simple but inaccurate for synthesized content
2. Mark everything [UNCERTAIN] — overly conservative, undermines trust in well-established theory
3. Assign per-cheatsheet based on source quality — accurate but requires judgment

**Decision:** Option 3 — per-cheatsheet confidence based on source quality
**Rationale:** Stability derivatives are well-established textbook theory → [TEXTBOOK]. Unit pitfalls are documented real-world incidents → [VERIFIED]. X-tail configurations are synthesized from multiple sources with less standardization → [DERIVED].
**Consequences:** Future cheatsheets must follow the same judgment framework. When in doubt, use the lower confidence level.
**Status:** ACTIVE
