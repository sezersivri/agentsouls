## Session: miles-2026-02-18-001

**Project:** agentsouls setup
**Task:** Create initial aerospace knowledge base — distill stability derivatives, unit pitfalls, and X-tail configuration reference cheatsheets
**Duration:** ~2 hours
**Outcome:** SUCCESS

### What I Did
- Created 3 cheatsheets covering core aerospace knowledge domains
- Populated stability-derivatives.md with sign conventions, typical ranges, and worked examples
- Populated common-unit-pitfalls.md with unit conversion tables, famous mishaps, and detection patterns
- Populated x-tail-configurations.md with control allocation matrices and coupling analysis

### What I Learned
- Cheatsheet format works well for distilling dense reference material — the WARNING blocks and worked EXAMPLES sections are especially valuable for quick recall
- The `_index.md` must be updated immediately when cheatsheets are created, or the progressive disclosure system breaks

### Mistakes Made
- None this session

### Decisions Made
- Chose [TEXTBOOK] confidence level for stability derivatives (well-established theory)
- Chose [DERIVED] for X-tail configurations (synthesized from multiple sources, less standardized)
- Chose [VERIFIED] for unit pitfalls (based on documented real-world incidents)

### Cheatsheets Updated
- stability-derivatives.md — created (217 lines)
- common-unit-pitfalls.md — created (271 lines)
- x-tail-configurations.md — created (231 lines)

### Follow-up Needed
- [ ] Add hypersonic regime notes to stability-derivatives.md when working on high-Mach projects
- [ ] Create a cheatsheet for reference frame transformations (body-axis, stability-axis, wind-axis)
