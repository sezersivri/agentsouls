# Project Registry

> All projects that use agentsouls as a submodule are listed here.
> This helps agents understand cross-project context.

## Adding a Project

When a new project integrates agentsouls:

1. Add it to the table above
2. Note which agents are primarily used
3. Document any project-specific conventions in the project's own CLAUDE.md
