## Loading an Agent

1. Read @GENERAL_RULES.md
2. Read the agent's CORE.md (paths listed above)
3. Check their memory/mistakes.md
4. Scan their cheatsheets/_index.md
5. Load relevant cheatsheets for the current task

## Session End

Before ending any session, follow the session-end protocol in @GENERAL_RULES.md:
update session-log.md, mistakes.md, decisions.md, and cheatsheets.
