1-understand how "agents team" works from claude code docs, 2- as far as i know we dont need personalities for those agents, since they will mostly work inside of agents team. and also seperate personalities for an ai colleague we probably dont need. since agents team work with each other they should be working very efficiently like a clock! 3-there should be an aerodynamicst of course, but we should probably create seperate specialist software developers as well. since i am not a software developer, decide at least 2 or many specialized software developers in industry standarts. 4- not all of them should use opus probably. especially in software developer agents maybe there can be a junior senior system. big ones can use opus and easy tasks can be done by sonnet. 5-of course now we have opus 4.6 and sonnet 4.6 but code should adapt future so if newer models exist, these agents should be updated as well. also these models might have a light or heavy modes, look it from docs and plan accordingly. 6-we are doing this "agent souls " project for mostly claude code. but it would be nice if this repo can also be used by gemini cli as well. in future maybe. 7-we should steal all great features or all awesome ideas about this from letta, they are already open sourced right? integrate all useful skills from them. 8-"an aerodynamicist, a cfd engineer, a missile datcom expert, multiple software developers, multiple specific researchers"and similarly do these for my other projects, "multiple game developers, multiple ios developers, multiple market searcher or stock market expert" help me decide their main professions based on your knowledge on me. 9- "git submodule add https://github.com/[you]/agent-souls .agents" are we gonna summon these when we started or working on an already existing project this way? in our blueprint we dont need specificly name like "stoolkit". this is a general project. 10-maybe when we clone these agent souls and then there is a read me file which explains claude code how to use them?
