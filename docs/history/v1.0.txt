Agent Souls v1.0 — Project History
====================================
Date: 2025-02-18 (inception) through 2026-02-18 (v1.0)

1. Origin
---------
Agent Souls began as a conversation between Sezer Sivri and Claude about a
persistent AI team system. The core idea: instead of stateless coding agents
that forget everything between sessions, create named specialists with
identities, domain knowledge, and memory of past work — all stored as
version-controlled Markdown files in Git.

The conversation explored existing tools (Letta/MemGPT, CrewAI, AutoGen,
OpenHands) and concluded that while multi-agent orchestration frameworks
existed, none offered a lightweight, file-based approach to persistent agent
identity that worked across different AI CLI tools. Claude Code's built-in
sub-agent spawning already handled orchestration — what was missing was the
"who they are and what they know" layer.

2. Design Decisions
-------------------
Key decisions from the initial design phase:

- Markdown-native: All agent data stored as plain .md files, readable by
  humans and AI tools alike. No databases, no runtimes.
- Git-first: Every learning, mistake, and session is a git commit. Agents
  have a literal commit history of their growth.
- Cheatsheet pattern: Instead of loading full textbooks into context, agents
  create compressed "cheatsheets" from reference materials. This preserves
  context window space while retaining actionable knowledge.
- Progressive disclosure: Agents load only CORE.md + mistakes + cheatsheet
  index at startup. Full cheatsheets load on-demand per task.
- Cross-tool compatibility: Designed primarily for Claude Code (.claude/agents/)
  but also packaged as skills (.agents/skills/) for Gemini CLI and Codex CLI.
- Model-tier routing: Opus for domain leads and complex analysis, Sonnet for
  specialist implementation, Haiku for testing and documentation tasks.
- Session-end protocol: Mandatory self-update sequence (session log, mistakes,
  decisions, cheatsheets) enforced through GENERAL_RULES.md.

3. Original Blueprint
---------------------
The master blueprint defined the full architecture: repository structure,
file specifications (CORE.md, cheatsheet template, memory templates),
starter agent definitions, and an 8-phase implementation plan covering
repo setup, agent identity creation, knowledge seeding, integration
testing, and ongoing self-improvement loops.

The blueprint established three starter agents (an aerodynamicist, a software
developer, and a research analyst) as proof of concept, with the system
designed to scale to any number of agents across any professional domain.

4. Evolution to v1.0
---------------------
The project evolved from the original 3-agent concept to a full roster of
17 agents across 6 domains (aerospace, software development, research,
game development, iOS development, and financial). Key additions during
development:

- Single source of truth: agents/manifest.json as the machine-readable
  registry, with auto-generation of tool-specific config files.
- Validation system: Python-based validation script for CI integration.
- Cross-tool packaging: SKILL.md files for Gemini/Codex alongside native
  Claude Code agent wrappers.
- Three-AI review: Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and Codex CLI collaboratively
  reviewed the architecture and produced a consensus improvement plan.
